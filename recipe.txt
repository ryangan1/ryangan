This saying goes for both biological and spiritual meaning. 
Food is a crucial source of our health and well-being and 
can say a lot about the way we choose to treat ourselves. 
It can be a splendid source of pleasure and delight, bringing 
taste and color to our lives while helping us to stay healthy

but also the way we relate to other people. Food is a gate to
 your own and to different cultures. A way to discover other 
cultures and create meaningful connections to other people.
